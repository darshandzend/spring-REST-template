# spring-REST-template

(I'm doing this while learning Spring 4.0)

The goal here is to create a "Template" RESTful API service using Spring 4.0 which includes basic and essential components:
* Validation (Using Spring)
* Logging (I know, very basic. Still..)
* Multiple layers of operation
* Error handling
* //TODO: ADD THINGS HERE

Ideally, anyone should be able to just pick this up and start implementing business logic right away
